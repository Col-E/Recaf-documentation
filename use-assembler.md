# TODO

- Variable instructions can refer to variables by their name
- Code offsets use named labels
- One-line source-level expressions can be directly written and translated to bytecode
- A table of local variables is provided and updated as you make changes
- The stack and local values of any frame can be accessed by selecting a line and looking at the analysis tab
- Bytecode is verified live as you make changes to make everything is valid
- Comments written in the assembler can be saved and loaded between edits
