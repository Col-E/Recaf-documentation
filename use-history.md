If you are in a situation where you have made a couple of edits to a class and something isn't working, you can undo your changes in the history manager.

Alternatively in the tab a class is represented in, you can hit the undo bind `Control + U`. The normal `Control + Z` will remain the standard text undo feature you would expect from any text editor.
